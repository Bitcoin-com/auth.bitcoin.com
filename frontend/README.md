# frontend
This directory holds the compiled front end user interface. This directory
is added to the `.gitignore` file so that data is not saved to this directory.
The code controlling the front end user interface is in
the [cloud.bitcoin.com repository](https://github.com/Bitcoin-com/cloud.bitcoin.com).
